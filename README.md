# TASK

A job is a collection of tasks, where each task has a name and a shell command. Tasks may
depend on other tasks and require that those are executed beforehand. The service takes care
of sorting the tasks to create a proper execution order.
Here’s an example request body:
```json
{
   "tasks":[
      {
         "name":"task-1",
         "command":"touch /tmp/file1"
      },
      {
         "name":"task-2",
         "command":"cat /tmp/file1",
         "requires":[
            "task-3"
         ]
      },
      {
         "name":"task-3",
         "command":"echo 'Hello World!' > /tmp/file1",
         "requires":[
            "task-1"
         ]
      },
      {
         "name":"task-4",
         "command":"rm /tmp/file1",
         "requires":[
            "task-2",
            "task-3"
         ]
      }
   ]
}
```
For which an example response might look like the following:
```json
[
   {
      "name":"task-1",
      "command":"touch /tmp/file1"
   },
   {
      "name":"task-3",
      "command":"echo 'Hello World!' > /tmp/file1"
   },
   {
      "name":"task-2",
      "command":"cat /tmp/file1"
   },
   {
      "name":"task-4",
      "command":"rm /tmp/file1"
   }
]
```
Additionally, the service should be able to return a bash script representation directly:
```shell script
#!/usr/bin/env bash
touch /tmp/file1
echo "Hello World!" > /tmp/file1
cat /tmp/file1
rm /tmp/file1
```
Thus allowing us to run the commands directly from shell, for example:
```shell script
$ curl -d @mytasks.json http://localhost:4000/... | bash
```
